I created a sales dataset using Python and SQLite with multiple product entries.
Then SQL was used to find the total quantity sold and total revenue of every product.
The data was read into Python using Pandas so it was easy to analyze.
To make the results clear, I created a bar chart in Matplotlib showing which product earned the most.
At the end, I generated a PDF report that includes the summary table, chart, and final results.
